TVRefresh: Subfolder touch automation for media server
=========================================================

Dumb basic script to touch parent folders when subfolders are updated. For whatever reason on my HTPC this didn't occur at the OS level (?) -- when a file is downloaded into the appropriate show/season subfolder, the show folder isn't updated. This fixes that.

Lazy and messy.

Usage
=====

I have a screen set to run the script every 30 minutes at certain times during the week (when files are expected) with the unix command 'watch'.
